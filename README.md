Reflection
What color choices did you make and why?
I chose blue, white, and black to give the design a clean and professional appearance. Blue adds a calm and trustworthy feeling, while white keeps it neat and spacious. Black was used for text and accents to maintain readability and contrast.

How did you apply accessibility fixes?
I made sure the colors had enough contrast so that the text was easy to read. I also used clear, readable fonts and avoided using color alone to convey meaning. These changes helped make the design more user-friendly and inclusive for everyone.

What challenges did you face?
I found it challenging to balance the color contrast while keeping the layout visually appealing. Adjusting the shades without making the design too dark or too light took some time. I also found the sizing of the text challenging, as I had to make sure it was both readable and visually balanced.<img width="1890" height="831" alt="homepage_mockup png" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/e313943a-db7b-4933-93f3-55b4d75d69a5" />
